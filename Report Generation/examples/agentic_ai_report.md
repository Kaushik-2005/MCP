**Introduction to Agentic AI and Its Applications**
=====================================================

Agentic AI is a revolutionary technology that combines the power of artificial intelligence, automation, and large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous agents capable of understanding, building, and performing complex business processes. These agents can analyze data, set goals, and take actions with decreasing human supervision, enabling enterprises to automate specific tasks and power intelligent systems** (Source 4).

**Agentic Search in Action**

Agentic search is a practical application of agentic AI, where agents use internal thought processes to identify user locations, run separate Google searches, and find relevant information. For instance, an agent can identify a user's location, use Google Events Search to find events in Frisco, and then use Google Maps to find stargazing locations near Frisco, Texas (Source 1). This demonstrates the agent's ability to reason, think, and use various tools to accomplish tasks.

**Building Effective AI Agents**

Building effective AI agents requires a combination of building blocks, workflows, and agents. The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale (Source 2). Workflows, on the other hand, offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks.

**Agentic RAG: Combining Agents with Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

Agentic RAG represents a powerful synergy between Retrieval-Augmented Generation and autonomous AI agents, enabling systems to operate with unparalleled intelligence, adaptability, and relevance (Source 5). Agentic RAG Routers are systems designed to dynamically route user queries to appropriate tools or data sources, enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This enables systems to operate with unparalleled intelligence, adaptability, and relevance.

**Applications of Agentic AI has numerous applications, including:**

* **Automation of complex business processes**: Agentic AI enables enterprises to automate specific tasks, and power intelligent systems capable of understanding context, adapting to new information, and collaborating with humans to solve complex challenges (Source 4).
* **Enhanced customer experience**: Agentic RAG Routers can dynamically route user queries to appropriate tools or data sources, enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and providing accurate answers to complex queries (Source 5).
* **Improved efficiency**: Agentic RAG Architecture enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with corrective steps for accurate answers, integrating generative AI with advanced retrieval mechanisms (Source 5).
