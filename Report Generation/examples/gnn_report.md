### Introduction
===============

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a cornerstone in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems. The 2020s are shaping up to be the time of GNNs for learning on graphs, in addition to attention-based architectures such as graph transformers [1]. As GNNs continue to gain popularity, characterizing and understanding them is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks and facilitating their deployment in parallel and distributed systems.

**The Importance of GNNs**
-------------------------

GNNs have become a crucial component in various machine learning and deep learning tasks, particularly when working with graph data. Models that can learn from graph inputs are essential for working with graph data effectively [2]. The transferability of GNNs is useful in practice, especially in recommendation systems, where performance differences on training and target graphs decrease as the size of the training graph grows [3].

**Challenges in GNNs**
--------------------

Despite the substantial work in this area, a comprehensive survey on characterizing and understanding GNNs from a computer architecture perspective is lacking [4]. Moreover, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks [5]. These challenges highlight the need for a comprehensive review of GNNs, covering concepts, architectures, techniques, and applications.

**The Rise of GNNs
------------------------------------------------

The popularity of GNNs can be attributed to their ability to learn from graph data, which is a standard data format for various machine learning and deep learning tasks. The University of Pennsylvania has been at the forefront of GNNs, offering courses and tutorials on the subject, including ESE 5140: Graph Neural Networks, which has been offered five times [1]. A short course on Graph Neural Networks was also taught at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) in 2023, capped with 40 students [1].

In conclusion, GNNs have become an essential component in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains. However, characterizing and understanding GNNs is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks and facilitating their deployment. This report aims to provide a comprehensive review of GNNs, covering concepts, architectures, techniques, and applications.

**The Rise of Graph Neural Networks**

The 2020s are shaping up to be the era of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning on graphs, alongside attention-based architectures such as graph transformers [1]. GNNs have become a cornerstone in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems [3].

**Characterizing and Understanding GNNs**

Characterizing and understanding GNNs is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks and facilitating their deployment in parallel and distributed systems [2]. Despite substantial work in this area, a comprehensive survey on characterizing and understanding GNNs from a computer architecture perspective is lacking [2]. This knowledge gap highlights the need for a comprehensive survey to facilitate the deployment of GNNs have shown promising results in various applications, including recommendation systems, where the transferability of GNNs is useful in practice [4]. The performance difference on training and target graphs decreases as the size of the training graph grows [4].

**Interplay between Model Interpretability and Robustness

The interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks [3]. This raises concerns about the robustness of GNNs, which is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications.
* Recommendation systems, for instance, rely on the robustness of GNNs to provide accurate recommendations.

**Fundamental Properties and Applications of GNNs**

GNNs have been applied to a wide range of conventional use cases, including graphs [5]. Graph data provides relational information between elements and is a standard data format for various machine learning and deep learning tasks. Models that can learn from such inputs are essential for working with graph data effectively [5].

In conclusion, GNNs have become a crucial component in graph-based data analysis. However, there is a need for characterizing and understanding GNNs from a computer architecture perspective. Moreover, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood. Further research is required to address these knowledge gaps and facilitate the deployment of GNNs in real-world applications.
